### Analogue Algorithm
This project started in a really analogue way. Two times 10 people were asked to follow some instructions and perform an algorithm.

##### Given Instructions: 
######  1.  Fix the cord on the grid (on any pin).
######  2.  Create a pattern.
######  3.  You are allowed to connect neighbours pins an not to skip.
######  4.  You must use the whole length of the cord.
######  5.  Fix the end of the cord to any pin.

##### The analogue results:

### Digital Algorithm
The next goal was to translate the analogue into a digital algorithm using p5.js. The main difficulty was to create a grid, in which the programm could connect a starting point to one of its neighbour points and set the reached point as the new starting point for the next repetition.

The following logical explanation allows to create a grid of any misure, in which every point has an index and a mathematical relationship to its neighbour points.
