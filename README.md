# LineLights
###  This *Algorithm* is my contribution to the topic Generative Design in *Steel Ant - Eingabe Ausgabe*, a class taught by Fabian Mor√≥n Zirfas, University of applied science - Potsdam (Germany).
#### This project started in a really analogue way. Two times 10 people were asked to follow some instructions and perform an algorithm.

##### Given Instructions: 
######  1.  Fix the cord on the grid (on any pin).
######  2.  Create a pattern.
######  3.  You are allowed to connect neighbours pins an not to skip.
######  4.  You must use the whole length of the cord.
######  5.  Fix the end of the cord to any pin.

##### The analogue results:
