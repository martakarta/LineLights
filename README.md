###  An *Algorithm Project* in the Class *Eingabe Ausgabe* by Fabian Mor√≥n Zirfas. 
#### The goal of this project was to write an algorithm starting in a really analogue way. Two times 10 people were asked to follow the given instructions and perform their algorithm.
##### Given Instructions: 
######  1.  Fix the cord on the grid (on any pin).
######  2.  Create a pattern.
######  3.  You are allowed to connect neighbours pins an not to skip.
######  4.  You must use the whole length of the cord.
######  5.  Fix the end of the cord to any pin.



##### Some of the analogue results:
